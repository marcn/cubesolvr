CubeSolvr - Solve a Rubik's Cube in your browser using a webcam and computer vision

This is a project created in two days for a "hack-a-thon" competition.  Since the hack-a-thon it has been extended and tweaked to further improve the accuracy and ease of use.  There is still a lot to do, including major code refactoring, cleanup, commenting, etc.


To try the app go to http://novakowski.net/cubesolvr
To play with the test page go to http://novakowski.net/cubesolvr/test.html

IMPORTANT: the code assumes solid color squares on the cube and will probably not work with official Rubik's Cubes that have a logo on the white center.

More documentation and info to come.
