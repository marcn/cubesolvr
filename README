CubeSolvr - Solve a Rubik's Cube in your browser using a webcam and computer vision

This is a project created in two days for the 2011 Hack-a-thon at Pandora (engineering department).  Since the hack-a-thon it has been extended and tweaked to further improve the accuracy and ease of use.  There is still a lot to do, including major code refactoring, cleanup, commenting, etc.  Accuracy of color matching is still quite poor (especially with reds and oranges) and there is a new algorithm I plan on trying that should greatly improve things.
